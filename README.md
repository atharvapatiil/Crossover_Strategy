<h1>Simple Moving Average (SMA) crossover strategy in Python</h1>
<p1>
  A simple moving average (SMA) calculates the average of a selected range of prices, usually closing prices, by the number of periods in that range.
  <p1>
    SMA = (A1+A1+A3+...An) / n
    where:
      An = the price of an asset at period n
      n = the number of total periods
